# Personal Website

This is the code for my personal website. This site is meant to be a showcase of my career, projects, and writing.

This site was originally built with Figma's Make AI and then manually redesigned and refined. The project uses React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Running the code

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
